# Paper

Logging lightweight as paper

## Done:
- Ideally source location
- Template log calls
- Backtrace logging
- Better consumer thread usage for logging to file (?)
- Print `\n` nicely
- Ensure support for logging ustrings

## TODO:
- Flush needs to happen before crash (perhaps signal handler?, Less important)
- Support for logging things that are c# instances by logging pointer value then calling to string (in bs-hooks)
